# Ephemeral ECS

> For when you can't afford monthly VMs ðŸ™ƒ 

This is a collection of nix scripts that I use to create declarative environments in *Elastic Cloud Servers*

## I don't know what nix is!

It's a package manager that allows for declarative system configuration, check out the [official docs](https://nixos.org/) for a better explanation

## Instalation

``` sh
# todo
```

## Usage

``` sh
# todo
```
